# Python_Capstone_Project

**Key Tasks Completed**:

- Created and cleaned multiple DataFrames using Pandas
- Handled missing values using a running average (with for loops)
- Performed data merging to create a consolidated dataset
- Added calculated columns like project bonuses and total project cost
- Applied conditions to update designation levels based on project status and employee age
- Filtered data based on custom logic (e.g., employees from cities containing “o”)

**Tools & Libraries Used**:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Jupyter Notebook

This project helped strengthen my skills in data cleaning, conditional logic, and working with multiple related datasets — all essential for real-world data analysis.
