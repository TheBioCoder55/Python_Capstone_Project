# # 📁 Excel + Python Project: Employee & Project Data Analysis

## 📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I used **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** alongside structured Excel data to perform advanced data cleaning, transformation, and business rule application. The aim was to simulate a real-world employee-project scenario and generate meaningful insights through data manipulation.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- 🧹 Clean and transform multiple datasets using **Pandas**
- 🔗 Merge related data to create a **unified, analysis-ready** dataset
- 🧮 Apply custom logic to calculate bonuses, costs, and role levels
- 🔍 Filter and analyze employee and project information based on business needs
- 💡 Strengthen skills in **data wrangling**, **conditional logic**, and **multi-table joins**

---

## ✅ Key Tasks Completed
- 📊 **Created and cleaned** multiple DataFrames from structured Excel files
- ⚙️ Handled **missing values** using a running average logic via `for` loops
- 🔗 **Merged datasets** (employee + project info) into one consolidated DataFrame
- ➕ Created **calculated columns** for:
  - 💸 Project Bonuses  
  - 🧾 Total Project Cost
- 🧠 Applied **conditional logic** to:
  - Update **designation levels** based on employee age and project status
  - Filter employees based on custom conditions (e.g., cities containing the letter **“o”**)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📘 Pandas  
- 📐 NumPy  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook  
- 📊 Microsoft Excel (for initial data source)
